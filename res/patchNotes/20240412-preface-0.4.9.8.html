	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	While this version was supposed to be a hotfix focused on fixing bugs, I ended up getting distracted and adding some small new features and content. Although I have managed to get some bugs fixed, the issue where stored cum (in condoms, milking rooms, and in orifices) would update to take into account transformations in the owner's body took longer to fix than expected, so I didn't get nearly as many bugs fixed as I wanted to. There was (so far as I can see) only one major game-breaking bug in the last version, where the game would sometimes freeze and crash when an orgasm sex action caused body parts to get covered in cum. I've got that fixed, so hopefully there won't be any need for another hotfix...
</p>
<p>
	The next update is almost certainly going to be a preview version on SubscribeStar. I'll release more details of what's going to be in it soon!
