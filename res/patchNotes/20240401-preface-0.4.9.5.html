<p>
	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	First of all, I'm so sorry for how long it's taken me to get this version out. I went through some bad times over the past several months, and I let myself sink into a self-destructive state of mind in which I found it impossible to do pretty much anything. I feel very guilty about the lack of updates and terrible communication, and I hope that I can make it up to you with more consistent updates going forwards.
</p>
<p>
	So, as for this update, I've finished implementing the core mechanics for the new doll race, and added the ability to buy dolls from Lovienne's Luxuries. I also used the framework which I added to support inanimate doll behaviour in sex to implement 'sleep sex' mechanics. I've also added a few other minor things and fixed some bugs.
</p>
<p>
	There are so many things which I wanted to add for this update, but as I've only just got back into the swing of things I simply ran out of time in which to implement them. The doll 'command' immobility mechanics in particular were quite time-consuming to implement, as I had to add support for a non-reactive character to all sex actions and quick sex descriptions. I particularly wanted to get a lot more bugs fixed for this version, and although I've done extensive testing on the new mechanics, I am a little worried that I didn't thoroughly hunt down all potential bugs. As such, if there are any major bugs in this version I will get a hotfix released by the end of the week.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you all for your support, concern, and kind comments during the past few months. Although I failed to communicate with you all, I did lurk and read what a lot of you were saying on discord and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, I know that this update is a little thin considering how much time has passed since the last update. Please consider this release the start of a return to a more frequent update schedule, and I'll make sure to get a decent amount of content added within the next couple of updates.
</p>
<p>
	See you again soon!
</p>
