<h2>v0.4.9.5</h2>

<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added parser hooks for slave jobs and slave job settings, prefaced SLAVE_JOB_ and SLAVE_JOB_SETTING_.</li>
	<li>Added an optional 'doesNotAge' value to subspecies files to set whether or not members of that subspecies have their age appearance increment as normal.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added more dialogue to Saellatrix (the succubus in the new sex toy shop).</li>
	<li>Finished implementing doll race mechanics, more details below.</li>
	<li>Added support for 'sleep sex', allowing you to engage in sleep sex with your sleeping slaves or friendly occupants. Your sleeping partner requires the new 'heavy sleeper' perk to be an active trait in order to have sex with them in their sleep.</li>
	<li>Added 'heavy sleeper' perk, as mentioned above, which enables sleep sex and also applies a 10x health and aura regeneration rate. (This addition did not require perk trees to be reset, so all characters' perks are unaffected when loading into this version.)</li>
	<li>Added sleep sex content for Kate (the succubus in 'Succubi's Secrets' in Dominion's shopping arcade).</li>
	<li>If the player has the 'heavy sleeper' trait active, then slave sex when sleeping in your room will now take place as sleep sex instead of being woken for sex by horny slaves. (Slaves require the 'Use you' permission and to be assigned to your room in order to be involved in this scene.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dolls:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now purchase dolls from Saellatrix, with several options available to customise the doll when purchasing it.</li>
	<li>Removed some references implying dolls could get pregnant/impregnate others.</li>
	<li>Dolls will no longer spawn with special perks (such as 'dirty minded', 'health fanatic', etc.).</li>
	<li>Dolls no longer suffer from chastity status effects.</li>
	<li>You now correctly receive no essences post-sex from dolls' orgasms.</li>
	<li>Dolls' perk trees are no longer described as being a work-in-progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a new content option for setting how often you want to see full descriptions of revealed body parts during sex. (Accessed via 'Content options' -> 'Sex & Fetishes' -> 'Full exposure descriptions', with 'Always' as the default setting.)</li>
	<li>Minor improvements to some sex action text.</li>
	<li>Immobilised characters can no longer displace or remove clothing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added dalmatian subspecies for dog-morphs (to be a dalmatian, be a dog-morph with floppy ears and white fur with black spots).</li>
	<li>Added 'femininity' and 'race' as sorting options for the slave management dialogue.</li>
	<li>The shady dealer will no longer sell Biojuice canisters before you've completed the slime queen side quest (to avoid an issue where the quest would not be available if you were already a slime before encountering a slime in Submission for the first time).</li>
	<li>The 'waiter/waitress' slave job now has a 0.5 hourly obedience increment (up from 0) to bring it in line with similar jobs.</li>
	<li>Demons, slimes, youko, elementals, and dolls no longer have their age appearance increment with the passage of time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Parsing and typo fixes.</li>
	<li>Fixed game freeze error when using the 'Inspect' action under a slaves' 'Management' tab.</li>
	<li>Fixed incorrect tooltip sizes & formatting for slave jobs.</li>
	<li>Characters who are immobilised in sex scenes can no longer use the 'spread legs' or 'pull hair', 'grab horns', etc. actions.</li>
	<li>Fixed incorrect quick sex description when fucking someone's armpits.</li>
	<li>Minor fixes to dialogue flow in a few places (such as the response tab not resetting to the first one when exiting out of the slave management screen).</li>
	<li>Freedom Certificates no longer disappear when examining them in your inventory.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where quick loading in the main menu was throwing a background error.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where some positioning actions were available when they shouldn't have been in 'chair sex' and 'toilet stall' sex positions.</li>
