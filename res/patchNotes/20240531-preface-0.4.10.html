	Hello!
</p>
<p>
	I've got a lot of bugs and minor changes implemented for this version, but unfortunately the main part of this update, which was to be a doll-related side quest, isn't quite ready yet. This is due to there ebing a lot more writing than I expected, which is taking me some time to get though (I've done about 30k words for it so far, and it's about 80% done). I'm going to continue working on the side quest immediately after this version is released, and I'll make a hotfix update as soon as I've got it finished.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you so much for your support and patience. I'll get the new side quest content to you as soon as I possibly can!
</p>
